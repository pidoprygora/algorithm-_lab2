# Creating a ready-to-run Python solution for the lab.
# It implements:
# 1) A string set with polynomial rolling hash and separate chaining, supporting +, -, ? operations (until a '.' line).
# 2) Variant utilities:
#    - groupdups: count duplicate strings (only those with count>1)
#    - palin: print all palindromic strings (unique or with counts)
#    - z: compute Z-function of a single string
#
# Usage examples (from shell):
#   python lab2_polyhash.py                 # interactive ops mode: read lines like "+ abc", "? x", "- y", "."
#   python lab2_polyhash.py groupdups       # read N then N strings, print "string count" for duplicates
#   python lab2_polyhash.py palin           # read N then N strings, print palindromes with counts
#   python lab2_polyhash.py z               # read one string, print Z-array
#
# All hashing is polynomial (64-bit wraparound).
